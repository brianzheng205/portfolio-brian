# **Assignment 6 - User Testing & Analysis**

## Task List

| Task                   | Instruction                                                                                                                  | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account Creation       | Create an account                                                                                                            | I want to learn right off the bat if the navigation bar is intuitive for users to use since this task requires users to navigate to the Login page. I also want to see if they instinctively start typing in the Login inputs to create an account rather than the Create An Account inputs because the Login ones are on top and are easier to reach for.     |
| Posting                | Create a post to share to everyone that you've just joined the app. Make the post public so that users can find your profile | I want to test how intuitive finding the Post Creation page is. I also want to see how well the instructions about linking the user's username to the post work.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Anonymous Commenting   | Comment on someone else's post anonymously                                                                                   | I want to test if the posts layout is intuitive and if the commenting button is easy to find. I also want to test if they understand the instructions for linking their username to the comment.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Joining a Competition  | Join a competition                                                                                                           | I want to test how quickly users can navigate to this page. This page is grouped with the Profiles page under "Search" on the navigation bar so I want to learn how intuitive it is that competitions is under "Search".                                                                                                                                       |
| Add a Friend           | Send a friend request to someone                                                                                             | Like joining a competition, I want to learn how intuitive it is that profiles is under "Search". Then, I want to test if users can switch from competitions view to profiles view since the page defaults to competitions view.                                                                                                                                |
| Editing a Post         | Edit your post to add that you've already sent a friend request to someone                                                   | I want to test if they are able to find that editing is in the Home view as well. In most social media apps, this would fall under the user's profiles so I want to see if they can find this.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Creating a Competition | Create a competition that ends next week. Make sure to make it public that you created this competition                      | I want to test if they've learned how to link their profile to items. I also want to see if they remember that creating a competition is also under "Create".                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Logging Workouts       | Log workouts: one for exactly one week ago at intensity 90, one yesterday at intensity 95, and one today at intensity 100    | The UI for logging a workout is probably the most involved in my app, so I want to test if they are able to use it well. This is not a feature that is in existing social media apps, so I want to test if this will be easy for people to learn how to use.                                                                                                   |
| Filter Workouts        | Filter the workout data to find only workouts from exactly one week ago                                                      | The filtering UI is one of the most complex features on this app. I want to see if they understand what the different buttons do. Specifically, I want to test if they understand that they need to specify both start and end dates to filter by a single date. I also want to see if they use the provided button to match the end date with the start date. |

## Study Reports

### Emily

Emily struggled initially to perform some tasks. When trying to join a competition, she was on the Home page and initially started scrolling because she thought competitions were on the Home Page. I think this happened because she felt that competitions—along with posts—should be something that shows up on your feed rather than something you can only explicitly search for. When trying to add a friend, she switched from the Search page (the correct page) to the Home page because she assumed she could click on the profile on someone’s post to view their profile and send them a friend request from there. She said she did this because most social media apps allow for users to click on the author’s profile on a post to interact with that author. I think she didn’t initially think to change the view of the Search page because the options are not readily visible to the users if they do not click on the view selector. These were problems in the Gulf of Execution.

After creating her anonymous comment, she was surprised and confused to see her name on her comment, which is a Gulf of Evaluation problem since she thought the linking feature worked incorrectly when in reality, it worked but the app didn’t convey it clearly to her. Her confusion is not surprising since she’s a new user and doesn’t know that’s how this app works.

For other tasks, Emily executed them effortlessly. She immediately navigated to the correct page to perform these tasks. She immediately understood that the question asking her if she wants to link her username to that item corresponds with anonymity. Even when she initially went to the wrong place to perform her task, she always found it immediately after she realized she was in the wrong place. I think this is because the places where I placed some functionality are common in other social media apps but also not the only places to execute them for those social media apps. For example, interacting with a user’s profile can be done either by clicking on their profile on one of their posts or by searching for them on Instagram and Twitter. Additionally, she was impressed to see filtering and sorting functionality for the workouts data and found the date selector very convenient.

### Victor

Victor struggled with joining a competition because he, like Emily, initially thought that competitions would be on the Home page. When creating a public post, he took a few seconds to understand that linking corresponded to anonymity, which is a small problem in Gulf of Execution. I think this is because I use the word “linking” rather than “anonymous,” which would be a much more familiar word to users. However, when he created an anonymous comment after that, he immediately selected “no” to linking his username to the comment, showing that he fully comprehends the function of linking. Like Emily, Victor was also surprised to see his name show up on his anonymous comment—a problem in the Gulf of Evaluation.

When first using the date input while creating a competition, he did not find the icon to open the calendar date input and instead, manually typed in the date. However, when entering dates to log data, he found the button and continued to use it afterwards. I believe this is because the date input for creating a competition is very wide compared to the one for logging data, creating a wide gap between the date text on the left and the calendar date selector icon on the right, so he did not see the icon.

For other tasks, Victor executed them effortlessly. He immediately navigated to the correct page to perform these tasks. When asked how he knew user profiles were under “Search,” he said that “It’s because you ‘search’ for users.” I think that unlike Emily, Victor was thinking of the searching users functionality in other social media apps rather than the clicking on user profiles on a post. Since Victor typed in the date for his date-related task, he especially appreciated the calendar date selecting feature since it was much quicker and more convenient. He also used the “Set End Date as Start Date” button to filter the workouts data by a singular date and found it very convenient and helpful. I think this shows that these accelerators are actually useful and desired and would be used by many regular users.

## Design Flaws/Opportunities

### Competitions On Home Page

**Flaw:** Users initially think competitions would be on the Home page.

**Level:** Conceptual

**Severity:** Minor

**Reason for Occurrence:** Other social media apps include items that you can search for to also be on your feed.

**Possible Solution:** Include competitions on the Home page.

### Linking vs Anonymous

**Flaw:** Some users got confused about what linking their username to an item means.

**Level:** Linguistic

**Severity:** Minor

**Reason for Occurrence:** Users are more familiar with the term anonymous and linking is more a developer term.

**Possible Solution:** Change the wording to not mention linking at all and just ask users if they want their post to be anonymous.

### Anonymous Indicator

**Flaw:** Users were surprised to see that their name showed up on their anonymous comment and required clarification that they performed the task correctly.

**Level:** Conceptual

**Severity:** Major

**Reason for Occurrence:** There is no indicator that the comment was made anonymous to the author.

**Possible Solution:** Add (Anonymous) after their name on posts, comments, and competitions.

### Interactive Profiles on Feed

**Flaw:** Some users thought they were able to interact with profiles (e.g. send a friend request) on posts.

**Level:** Conceptual

**Severity:** Moderate

**Reason for Occurrence:** Many social media apps support this feature.

**Possible Solution:** Create this functionality.

### Date Input Width

**Flaw:** Some users did not find the calendar date selecting icon while creating a competition.

**Level:** Physical

**Severity:** Minor

**Reason for Occurrence:** The width of the input was too large and it created too much separation between the date text on the left and the icon on the right. Some users simply did not see that the icon was there because they were focused on the text on the left.

**Possible Solution:** Make the width of the input smaller.

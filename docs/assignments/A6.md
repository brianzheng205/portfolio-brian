# **Assignment 6 - User Testing & Analysis**

## Task List

| Task                   | Instruction                                                                                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account Creation       | Create an account                                                                                                             | I want to learn right off the bat if the navigation bar is intuitive for users to use since this task requires users to navigate to the Login page. I also want to see if they instinctively start typing in the Login inputs to create an account rather than the Create An Account inputs because the Login ones are on top and are easier to reach for.     |
| Posting                | Create a post to share to everyone that you've just joined the app. Make the post public so that users can find your profile. | I want to test how intuitive finding the Post Creation page is. I also want to see how well the instructions about linking the user's username to the post work.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Anonymous Commenting   | Comment on someone else's post anonymously                                                                                    | I want to test if the posts layout is intuitive and if the commenting button is easy to find. I also want to test if they understand the instructions for linking their username to the comment.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Joining a Competition  | Join a competition                                                                                                            | I want to test how quickly users can navigate to this page. This page is grouped with the Profiles page under "Search" on the navigation bar so I want to learn how intuitive it is that competitions is under "Search".                                                                                                                                       |
| Add a Friend           | Send a friend request to someone                                                                                              | Like joining a competition, I want to learn how intuitive it is that profiles is under "Search". Then, I want to test if users can switch from competitions view to profiles view since the page defaults to competitions view.                                                                                                                                |
| Editing a Post         | Edit your post to add that you've already sent a friend request to someone                                                    | I want to test if they are able to find that editing is in the Home view as well. In most social media apps, this would fall under the user's profiles so I want to see if they can find this.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Creating a Competition | Create a competition that ends next week. Make sure to make it public that you created this competition                       | I want to test if they've learned how to link their profile to items. I also want to see if they remember that creating a competition is also under "Create".                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Logging Workouts       | Log workouts: one for last week at intensity 90, one yesterday at intensity 95, and one today at intensity 100.               | The UI for logging a workout is probably the most involved in my app, so I want to test if they are able to use it well. This is not a feature that is in existing social media apps, so I want to test if this will be easy for people to learn how to use.                                                                                                   |
| Filter Workouts        | Filter the workout data to find only workouts from exactly one week ago                                                       | The filtering UI is one of the most complex features on this app. I want to see if they understand what the different buttons do. Specifically, I want to test if they understand that they need to specify both start and end dates to filter by a single date. I also want to see if they use the provided button to match the end date with the start date. |

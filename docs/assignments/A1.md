# Assignment 1 - Social Media Needfinding

## Hunch

I would like to build a social media app for gym-goers—both beginners and experts. Everyone can share their gym journey, and experts can share their knowledge while beginners can learn from others.

## Interviewees Background

### Emily

Emily is a software engineer. While she could make time to go to the gym, she does not. I chose Emily because she can provide insights on what factors are preventing her from going to the gym and how my app can account for those factors to retain users and motivate them to continue going to the gym. Furthermore, she can provide unique insights about obstacles specific to women.

### John

John is a recent college graduate who studied Psychology. He has been going to the gym fairly consistently for the past few years. He is open to learning about different routines and techniques to improve his workouts. I chose John because he is an intermediate gym-goer that has qualities of both a beginner and an expert. He is willing to learn as well as teach.

## Interview Report

### Emily

Emily uses Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to stay connected with friends, but she doesn’t post often anymore, explaining, “there haven’t been any major milestones recently and I don’t like my recent pictures.” While she occasionally consumes “gym memes and jokes,” she doesn’t actively seek out workout advice or tutorials. One memorable insight was her appreciation for cooking videos on social media, which have taught her to “make a greater variety of dishes” and to “improvise more” through step-by-step tutorials and general tips.

What stood out to me most was Emily’s fear of judgment at the gym as someone who does not go to the gym regularly. She says, “I … do not know how to do the exercises and I am afraid to be judged by everyone there.” However, when working out with friends, she feels more comfortable, saying, “I’m close with my friends and I'm only focused on them and not the strangers at the gym. Also, my friends will show me the correct way to do the exercises so I can’t embarrass myself by doing it wrong.” This contrast between her anxiety when going alone and the confidence she gains with friends highlights the potential impacts of a social support system.

### John

John has been going to the gym consistently for several years because he wants to be strong and to look fit. He uses TikTok and YouTube daily for entertainment, which has led him to stumble upon gaming and fitness content that has helped him learn. His gym-related social media consumption includes workout tips, gym memes, and routines. John mentioned that he initially learned to work out from more experienced friends but now uses social media for tips on lifting techniques, stating, “Social media provides tips on how to make sure my lifting techniques are safe and optimal.” What stood out most was his balance between being a learner and a teacher—while he continues to refine his own workouts, he also enjoys helping friends who are new to the gym. Despite this, he feels “too shy for videos” but would consider providing written tips.

One of the more surprising insights from John’s interview was his use of the Hevy app, which he described as a social media platform for tracking workouts. While he appreciates that Hevy provides video simulations and step-by-step instructions for exercises, he pointed out a key limitation: “I wish it had videos of real people doing the exercises and explaining how to do them because I think it would convey the information better than text and they would address common mistakes.”

## Design Opportunities

### Real User Demonstrations for Exercises

A potential feature can provide video demonstrations with real people doing each exercise. Both Emily and John highlighted the importance of clear instructions. John noted a preference for videos of real people demonstrating exercises, as this would help him better replicate proper form compared to animated simulations. This would help regular gym-goers like John who are willing to learn and improve their workouts. This feature could also help beginners like Emily, who feel anxious about doing exercises incorrectly by providing helpful demonstrations that can teach them to do them correctly.

### Mentorship and Peer Support

A potential feature can allow beginner gym-goers to meet and work out with intermediates and experts. Emily mentioned feeling more comfortable when working out with friends who could guide her and correct her form while John has experience teaching friends at the gym. A feature that allows users to connect with more experienced gym-goers for guidance, mentorship, or workout partnerships could help beginners feel supported and more motivated, fostering a community-driven learning environment within the app.

### Safe Space

A potential feature can create a safe space for sharing gym progress and questions. Emily’s fear of being judged at the gym is a common barrier for beginners. A potential opportunity is to design a feature that creates a judgment-free space within the app, where users can share their experiences, challenges, and progress without fear of criticism. This could involve anonymous posting options or beginner-friendly discussion threads where users can ask questions and receive supportive feedback.

### Customizable Workout Plans with Expert Input

A potential feature can provide specialized workout plans that are customizable and tailored to the user’s level of experience. Since John is open to learning new routines and techniques, offering customizable workout plans that adapt to users’ goals and skill levels—created or endorsed by experts—would appeal to both beginners and intermediate users. This feature could provide structure for people like Emily, who are unsure how to start, and offer workouts tailored to beginners.

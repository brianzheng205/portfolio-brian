## PlantIt Testing and Walkthrough

The PlantIt interface is most useful and interactive when there are existing projects and tasks. These projects are not public to all users—the user must be a member of that project to see the information. For P5 testing and user testing purposes, we will provide a login to our app with pre-populated project data.

- username: p5usertesting
- password: p5password123

Please use this login to access our app in order to simulate a real-world experience with existing projects and tasks.

## Task List

| Task Title                   | Instruction                                                                                                                                                                         | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Viewing Your Tasks           | 1\. Log in, 2\. Find the tasks that are due in the next day                                                                                                                         | One of the core features of a project management app is that it allows a user to easily view a todo list of their tasks. By testing this we hope to not only confirm its easy to find your tasks but that the format is intuitive for users to understand. |
| Finding a Project            | 1\. Log in, 2\. Find the project called “Project1”, 3\. View the project page                                                                                                       | Finding a project is one of the critical actions a user needs to be able to do to interact with a project management site. Aside from testing to see that they can find it, we want to make sure that each click is intuitive.                             |
| Completing a Task            | 1\. Start on Home Page, 2\. Navigate to project page for “Project1”, 3\. Complete the task that is assigned to you                                                                  | Once users have found their tasks it's important that they can figure out how to interact with each task. Specifically, we want to see that users can complete tasks and clearly understand that the site has acknowledged it.                             |
| Creating a new Project \- PM | 1\. Start on Home Page, 2\. Create a Project, 3\. Add members “user2”, “user3”, 4\. View Project Page                                                                               | The first step to any project is its creation. Can a project manager create a new project? Can they ensure that the proper users are added to it? Is the location of all the buttons and boxes intuitive?                                                  |
| Assigning a Task \- PM       | 1\. Start on Project Page of your Project, 2\. Create a task for “user2” that is due tomorrow                                                                                       | Another critical functionality is allowing project managers to create a task and assign it to a specific user. We want to test that managers are not confused about any steps of this process.                                                             |
| Editing a Task \- PM         | 1\. Start on Project Page of your Project, 2\. Find the task that was assigned to “user2”, 3\. Reassign the task to “user3”, 4\. Change the task description, 5\. Unassign the task | The ability to edit a task is also important for project managers to understand. It's also important to be sure that they don’t get confused and accidentally delete a task instead of edit it.                                                            |
| Editing Your Project \- PM   | 1\. Start on Project Page of your Project, 2\. Add member “user4” 3\. Remove the existing member “user3”                                                                            | Part of maintaining a project is continuing to edit its members along the way. We want to be sure there is no confusion for managers when adding and removing users from a project.                                                                        |

# **Thoughts on Enlighten by Croissants**

I’m really excited about Enlighten because I’ve always wanted to experience the night sky and Aurora Borealis in their full glory without the interference of city lights. In the past year, there was so much hype about the Aurora being visible from the northern United States including Boston and Cambridge, but I was pretty disappointed when I could barely see anything from campus.

One feature I think would be amazing for Enlighten is a map that shows the view of the night sky from various locations. This can be photos submitted by users or live views from observatories. This would give people a clear idea of what to expect before traveling to experience it firsthand, ensuring they’re not disappointed by underwhelming views like many of us were.

I’d also love this feature as a way to explore the night sky from different places without needing to travel, especially when I’m too busy to make the trip. Furthermore, unlike just searching for photos of the Aurora or night sky, this would let me easily check out views of specific places I’m interested in rather than relying on pictures that could have been taken anywhere. This would help me explore and keep track of great spots I’d like to visit in the future in an intuitive and collected way.

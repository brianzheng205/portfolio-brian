# **Blog 2 \- Response to Matthew**

In his [blog](https://msequeir.github.io/portfolio-msequeir/blogs/blog4.html), Matthew talks about how the founders of big social media apps probably never meant social media to be harmful and that it is hard to control what users might do. I agree with Matthew and I think many people do as well. However, there are also people, especially those in older generations, who have some misplaced hate towards social media and its founders. Firstly, I don’t believe the founders should receive any hate because like Matthew points out, the founders do not have any bad intentions—they are trying to act in good faith. Secondly, I think more thought and reasoning needs to go towards hatred for social media apps.

Specifically, I am thinking of an incident where concerned parents were mad at the founders of several social media apps for letting inappropriate content be shared on their platforms. They wanted to ban these social media apps and I don’t believe that is the right solution because the platforms bring a lot of good to the world were not created to facilitate inappropriate activities, it is just an unfortunate side-effect that these founders are trying to stop. If they felt that social media apps should get banned, I think that they should feel equally passionate about banning cameras, which allow for the capturing of inappropriate content, hard drives, which allow for their storage, and the many other technologies that enable the sharing of inappropriate content.

I think there are some good points that support only being mad about social media as opposed to the other enabling technologies. Maybe you could argue that all the other enabling technologies are useful for many different things, but social media is the one technology that brings them all together to allow the easy and mass sharing of inappropriate content. However, I would argue that even without social media, there are still other ways to share inappropriate content (emailing, website ads and popups, etc.). Maybe social media makes the sharing of content too easy compared to these other methods, but then we would need to argue about where to draw the line.
